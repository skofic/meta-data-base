All elements of this ontology are terms that, depending on their properties, serve as *types*, *variables* and other elements that comprise the data dictionary.\n\nA term has *five sections*, or structures, that determine its *function*:\n\n- [Code section](term_code.md): this section contains *all* the necessary *properties* that *define* the *term identification*. This section determines the *unique identifier* of the term in the *database* and the various other *identifiers* by which the term is *referred* to *outside* of the data dictionary. All terms *require* this section.\n- [Information section](term_info.md): while the previous section is more relevant to a computer, this section provides *information* to *humans* regarding the *term*. The *structure* contains a set of *properties* that should provide a *title*, *definition*, *description*, *examples* and other textual data to *inform* a *reader* on what is the *purpose* of the term and *how* to *use* it. All terms *should require* this section, except if the term is an internal private element of the dictionary whose purpose is not to be published.\n- [Categories section](term_cats.md): this section contains a series of *controlled vocabulary* properties that collect all the *main categories* to which the *term belongs*. It includes the *classes*, *domains*, *keywords* and *tags* associated with the term. The purpose of this section is to *group* together all the *enumerated information*, this section is *not required*.\n- [Types section](term_type.md): this section is *required* by *terms* that *represent descriptors*, it contains *properties* that define the *shape* and *type* of the *data* the term can *hold*. The section indicates the *shape* of the *data*, whether it is a *scalar* value or a *container* of values, the *data type* of the scalar elements, and the *constraints* that apply to *values*.\n- [Properties section](term_prop.md): this section is *required* by *terms* that represent *structure types*. The section contains which properties are *required*, which *should not* be *included* and which properties one *may expect* in *descriptors* of *that type*.\n\nSince the *function* of a term *depends* on *which sections* it *features*, a term may fill *several roles*. For instance, a data structure descriptor may also represent the data type of that structure, in that case it would feature both the categories and properties sections.\n\nBesides the above sections, terms can be related in graph structures that are used to represent controlled vocabularies and other hierarchical structures. Elements of enumerations are related to each other by edge records which feature predicates and other data."

The field is *indexed* by *language* and the text is encoded in Markdown.
