This field makes sense only in situations where the term is a descriptor that must be filled using a special protocol, or in cases where it can be used in different ways. The field is *indexed* by *language* and the text is encoded in Markdown. This field is *optional*.\n- [Notes](notes.md) (`notes`): this is an *array* of Markdown encoded *notes* that users may share to provide a better understanding and feedback on the term. There is no language information, these notes are a notepad for users. This field is *optional*.\n- [References](references.md) (`references`): a list of Markdown encoded texts that should provide a *list* of *internet references* concerning the term.
